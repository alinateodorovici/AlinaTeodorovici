Hello, I’m Alina Teodorovici and this is my GitHub portfolio.

I’m interested in Quality Assurance Software Testing jobs and internships.

As a self-motivated and eager learner, I have gained knowledge of manual testing techniques and methodologies. I am familiar with the software development life cycle (SDLC), Agile methodology, identifying and documenting software defects and issues. Additionally, I have strong skills in creating and executing test cases and test plans with great attention to detail, analytical, and problem-solving abilities. I am also confident in my written and verbal communication skills, and have worked with tools such as Postman, Jira, GitHub, and TestRail.

I have a detail-oriented approach and a natural inclination towards teamwork, communication, and collaboration. With a positive attitude and a willingness to take on new challenges, as well as a strong desire to learn and grow within the field, I am excited to begin my journey in software testing and make meaningful contributions in this industry.
